Rotary Compression Tester

This repository contains code, models, and instructions for a DIY compression tester for rotary engines.

**Why is a special compression tester needed for a rotary engine?**

Because each rotor has 3 faces, any one of which can have differing compression numbers from the other two, and there is only one hole to measure compression from. This means that we need a compression tester that is able to figure out which face each compression pulse is coming from and separate them.

**Why cant I use a regular compression tester?**

You certainly can, but it doenst show you the whole picture. If the compression on one face of a rotor is bad, that will not show up on a regular tester, because the pulses from the other two faces are higher.

**What components do I need for this?**

1. A set of 3d printed parts for the case.
2. a screen: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07YNP2L95/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
3. an arduino nano: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B071NMD14Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
4. a 200 psi pressure transducer: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0748CVN3F/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1
5. an adapter from spark plug threads to 1/8 npt (JOEL TO SUPPLY LINKS HERE)
6. some hookup wire
7. a soldering iron
8. a usb cable

**How do I assemble this?**
