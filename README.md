Rotary Compression Tester

This repository contains code, models, and instructions for a DIY compression tester for rotary engines.

**Why is a special compression tester needed for a rotary engine?**

Because each rotor has 3 faces, any one of which can have differing compression numbers from the other two, and there is only one hole to measure compression from. This means that we need a compression tester that is able to figure out which face each compression pulse is coming from and separate them.

**Why cant I use a regular compression tester?**

You certainly can, but it doenst show you the whole picture. If the compression on one face of a rotor is bad, that will not show up on a regular tester, because the pulses from the other two faces are higher.

**What components do I need for this?**

1. A set of 3d printed parts for the case.
2. a screen: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07YNP2L95
3. an arduino nano: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B071NMD14Y
4. a 200 psi pressure transducer: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0748CVN3F
5. a 1/4 to 1/8 npt adapter https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0044F8YXW
6. a 14mm long-rech spark plug non-fouler https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000BYGJQY
7. some hookup wire (get the small stuff, nothing here needs high amperage, and its easier to fit into small spaces)
8. at least 9 heat set inserts, M2 X D4.0 X L3.0: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000232858343.html
9. at least 9 screws, m2 x 5mm long: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000282581926.html
10. a soldering iron
11. a usb cable

**How do I assemble this?**
